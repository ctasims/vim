# Windows Vim Settings Setup
On a new machine, perform these three steps:

1. Download plug.vim plugin to autoload directory (<user>/vimfiles/autoload)

2. Make directory for vim temp files: ~/vimtmp

3. Clone vim settings repo
```
$ git clone git@github.com:ctasims/vim.git p:/vim/
```

4. Tell vim to use settings file
Add this to `~/.vimrc` to load the repo's vim settings. Adjust as needed for non-windows:
```
let $MYVIMRC="p:/vim/vimrc"
source $MYVIMRC
```

5. Open vim and initialize plugins:
```
:PlugInstall
:PlugUpdate
:PlugClean - remove plugins that are deleted/commented out
:source ~/.vimrc
```
